# COOL-Compiler-Cpp
A simple COOL language compiler implemented by Cpp.

Cool, an acronym for Classroom Object Oriented Language. Cool language is lite and functional enough to explore the design and implementation of compiler. The implementation of COOL compiler is decoupled into four indenpendent components: lexer, parser, semantic analyser and code generator, which reads the previous phase's output and generator corresponding outputs.

- [PA1](./pa1/README): exploration of COOL language. Using cool to implement a stack.
- [PA2](./pa2/README): lexer. Writing REGEX with flex.
- [PA3](./pa3/README): parser. Generator CFG with bison.
- [PA4](./pa4/README): semantic analyser. Write augmented AST to do static type checking and enable inheritance graph.
- [PA5](./pa5/README): code generator. Reinforce AST to emit MIPS assembly code recognized by spim.
