README file for Programming Assignment 1
========================================


	The README contains this info. Part of the assignment is to
	answer the questions at the end of this README file.
	Just edit this file.

	atoi.cl is an implementation in Cool of the string to integer
	conversion function known from the C language.

	stack.cl is the skeleton file which you should fill in with
	your program.

	stack.test is a short test input to the stack machine.
	

Instructions
------------

	To compile and run your program, type:

	% make

        Try it now -- it should work, and print "Nothing implemented"
        (among a few other things).

	To submit your solution, run:

	% make zip

	Check the resulting zip file to make sure it contains everything
	it should. Then submit it on Gradescope.

	GOOD LUCK!

Questions on PA1
----------------

1. Describe your implementation of the stack machine in a single short
   paragraph.

Answer: 
  There are four important functional class in my code: 'Node', 'Stack', 'StackCommand', 'Main'.
  Implementation of the stack is based on linked list, and the basic cell that implements linked
list is 'Node', which only contains 'StackCommand' cell and next address. Stack mainly supports 
'push', 'pop' and 'getTop' functions.
  The 'StackCommand' is a general class for operators, it supports 'getVal' (get string presentation
of the command or operand) and 'eval' (operate the stack with corresponding subclass) and each of
its subclass map to a type of operator or the operand.
  The 'Main' provides the driver of testing. It reads string repeatedly and initialize corresponding 
class to operate on the stack or push to the stack.


2. List 3 things that you like about the Cool programming language.

Answer:
  1. Object-oriented: Inheritance makes design more flexible.
  2. Encapsulation: the only access to object state is through methods.
  3. Keywords: some interesting keywords like 'if' and 'fi' distinguish code blocks explicitly.

3. List 3 things you DON'T like about Cool.

Answer:
  1. Use of 'void': Unlike Java or C, void value doesn't have a name and can only judged by isvoid.
The void value can only be generated by usage of default initialization of class besides String and 
'Bool' or from a while loop. It's not easy to understand.
  2. Use of semicolons: Cool requires programmers to be cautious enough to consider when and where to
use semicolons especially respecting blocks and expressions.
  3. Do not have keywords like 'and' or 'or' to simplify boolean operation.
